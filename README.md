# Carlos Rubiano – AWS Cloud Architect | Serverless & AI/ML Architectures

Hi, I’m Carlos Rubiano — a Cloud Architect focused on designing scalable, event-driven, and AI-ready solutions on AWS. I specialize in building architectures that enable real-time data processing, automation, and machine learning at scale.

My background blends cloud architecture, serverless computing, and applied AI/ML workloads. I help organizations design secure, decoupled, and cost-efficient systems aligned with AWS best practices and business outcomes.

## What I Do

I design cloud-native architectures to:

- Automate intelligent workflows using AWS Lambda, Bedrock, and Step Functions
- Build resilient, event-driven applications with SQS, SNS, and API Gateway
- Integrate ML models into production with Bedrock and SageMaker
- Architect scalable data platforms using DynamoDB, Redshift, and Glue
- Enable observability and governance with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Infrastructure as Code
